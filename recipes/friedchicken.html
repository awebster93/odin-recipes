        <h2>This is my favorite recipe for southern fried chicken</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone that has tasted southern fried chicken knows the magic of that
            tangy, spicy, crunchy goodness. I grew up eating the chicken from my mom and
            aunts, and it carries a special place in my heart. Follow this recipe or
            try your own modifications.
