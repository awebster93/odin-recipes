# odin-recipes
This website is my first published HTML project.
It contains a homepage with headings, an image, and links to three recipes
The three recipe pages each contain an image, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps.
The recipes I entered are not real recipes with real instructions, only instructions used to complete the web pages.
The web pages currently have no CSS styling (22 December, 2021)
